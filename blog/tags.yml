# TODO: This file needs a lot of work, once done re-tagging of the developer blog is needed
# please refrain from using tags that are not defined here. 
# (because of this we are getting a lot of build warnings)
# 
# General advice when it comes to tagging: if only one blog post is using this tag, dont create it.
